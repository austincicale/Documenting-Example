### Project Overview

Brief, but informative explanation of what my project is about. Explain what the project aims to achieve and why it is important or interesting.
Example: This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the sales performance of an e-commerce company over the past year. By analyzing various aspects of the sales data, we seek to identify trends, make data-driven recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of the company's performance.

### Data Sources

Example: Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the sales_data.csv file, containing detailed info about each sale made by the company

### Tools

- SQL Server - Data Analysis
- PowerBI - Creating reports

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In EDA, mention the questions you asked to be able to find the trends in my data

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

- What is the overall sales trend?
- Which products are top sellers?
- What are the peak sales periods?

### Data Analysis

Include some interesting code features worked with

```sql
SELECT * FROM table1
WHERE cond = 2;
```
```r
# Your R code goes here
data <- read.csv("data.csv")
summary(data)

### Results/Findings
Summary of Analysis

The analysis results are summaries as follows:
1. The company's sales have been steadily increasing over the past year, with a noticeable peak during the holiday season.
2. Product Category A is the best-performing category in terms of sales and revenue
3. Customer segments with a high lifetime value (LTV) should be targeted for marketing efforts.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Invest in ...
- Focus on ...
- Implement ...

### Limitations

maybe you had to exclude some records because it would affect the accuracy of the analysis. So anything I did to modify data and exclude some records, mentioned in the limitations.

I had to remove all zero values from the budget and revenue columns because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis. There are still a few outliers even after the omissions but even there we can still see that there is a positive correlation between both budget and number of votes with revenue.
